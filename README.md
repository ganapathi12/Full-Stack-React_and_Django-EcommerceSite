# Full-Stack-React_and_Django-EcommerceSite
This is an e-commerce site completely built from scratch using Django as the backend and React as the frontend, it is built with a Braintree Payment gateway. Everything is done from Scratch with a Full user interface, it contains login, registering user separate admin panel, and payment gateway.

I have deployed Django API in python anywhere: http://gana016.pythonanywhere.com/ and to access the admin panel:
 -> http://gana016.pythonanywhere.com/admin/login/?next=/admin/
I have deployed the frontend react website in Netlify: 
 -> https://ecommerce-gana016.netlify.app/
